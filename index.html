    <p>
         Zomcorp is a survival game being developed by me William Saxton. Zomcorp the game is currently in the design stages of development and will be fully working
        and hosted here in a few weeks. The creation of this game is for a module i am currently attending at university. As i said Zomcorp will be a survival game, the game will be set
        in a labyrinth filled with zombies, you will play as an unknown survivor that has been trapped in this endless nightmare. This unknown survivor will be called Allan and hes a bit
        bit of a mad. Allan was trapped in this labyrinth by a company who he worked for as an enforcer when the zombies arose, Allan disobeyed an order that got him thrown in to the
        labyrinth. My initial design for the game is to have 3 diffrent types of zombies for players to kill vanilla, suicide, puker. More types might be added later, as for killing
        his foes Allan was given a pistol with unlimited ammo and he can also find diffrent guns and ammo for those guns by killing zombies and blowing up barrels. As it is early stages
        still i will say most of this could change drastically from the end product but this is just the initial designs which will be detailed in the game page.
