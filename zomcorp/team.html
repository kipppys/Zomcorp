        Hi im William, that is me with my dog on the right. I am a student at UWS studying Computer Games development, currently doing my honors year.
        This is my website well this is a sub domain anyway, next trimester i have a portfolio module and i assumed i would need a website to show off my work.
        If you go to
        <a style="font-family: Tahoma, Geneva, sans-serif; opacity: 1; font-size: 16px" target="_blank" href="http://williamsaxton.co.uk/MetaBit.html">
        http://williamsaxton.co.uk/MetaBit.html
        </a>
        you will see that game i created as part of a group project last year, that page its self is very blank
        but that is what im going to be working on later this year. In that project i was the programmer for the project and the game took about 2 months to code,
        as of right now that is the biggest game ive had to create in such a short timescale. This subdomain is for a game i am creating for a module called HTML5 and
        Javascript programming which has me creating this website and a game which is detailed on the game page on the left.
